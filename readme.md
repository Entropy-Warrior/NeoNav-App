Have you ever scrolled through your bookmarks only to feel lost in a sea of random icons and unreadable links? It's frustrating to hunt for what you need when everything looks the same. That's why I wanted something simpler: a clean, icon-based view where each bookmark has a short, meaningful name you can set and change as you like‚Äîso everything's right at your fingertips.

NeoNav is a lightweight, elegant bookmark manager for macOS that provides quick access to your favorite websites through a floating strip interface. It is exactly what I wanted, and I hope you will find it useful. ‚ú®
